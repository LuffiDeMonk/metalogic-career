# MetaLogic Replication Task
This project involves replicating the design, layouts, and functionality so that it closely resembles the Career section of the original Career section of MetaLogic website. The project was built on Next 14 and a famous component library called Shancdn/ui. Here is a list of all the tools that are utilized to create this website:

1. Next JS (Latest Next version 14.2.1)
2. Shancdn/ui (Unstyled component library)
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Framer Motion (React Animation Library)
5. Next-nProgress-bar
6. React Hook Form

### Design decision
Initially, original career section of the website was observed and its layout and component structure was studied. Then, Next JS was used because it provides features like SSR, SEO optimization which is important for a website. Shancdn/ui was chosen because it provides unstyled componenets which could be easily modified using Tailwind CSS. The components are also accessible to web crawlers which increases the SEO score of the website. Framer motion was selected to animate the components as it gives simple API to add animation to the website.
